  ranger = 150, opt_size = 20, min_size = 16, max_size = 22,

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{is the is dataframe after extensionï¼Œhere, each taget sequence requires the names (NO.)}

\item{generic}{is the input of The PRIMER_TASK that tells primer3 which type of primers to pick.
You can select typical primers for PCR detection, primers for cloning or for sequencing. Here,
PRIMER_TASK alsoccalled 'pick_detection_primers' is default setting  to 'generic' while
retaining 'pick_detection_primers' as an alias for backward compatibility.}

\item{oligo}{is the input of PRIMER_PICK_INTERNAL_OLIGO, which default is 0 .If the associated
value = 1 (non-0), then primer3 will attempt to pick an internal oligo (hybridization probe to
detect the PCR product).}

\item{rangel}{is the left range  of PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE input. The associated values specify the lengths
of the product that the user wants the primers to create, and is a space separated list of elements
of the form <x>-<y>,where an <x>-<y> pair is a legal range of lengths for the product. For example,
if one wants PCR products to be between 100 to 150 bases (inclusive) then one would set this parameter
 to 100-150. Here, default is 100-150}

\item{ranger}{is the lright  range  of PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE input.}

\item{opt_size}{is the input of PRIMER_OPT_SIZE, which is the Optimum length (in bases) of a primer.
Primer3 will attempt to pick primers close to this length. Here, default is 20.}

\item{min_size}{is the input of PRIMER_MIN_SIZE. The minimum acceptable length of a primer.
Must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to PRIMER_MAX_SIZE. Here,default is 16}

\item{max_size}{is the input of PRIMER_MAX_SIZE, The maximum acceptable length of a primer.
Must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to PRIMER_MIN_SIZE. Here,default is 22}

\item{explain_fiag}{is the input of If this flag is 1 (non-0), produce PRIMER_LEFT_EXPLAIN,
PRIMER_RIGHT_EXPLAIN, PRIMER_INTERNAL_EXPLAIN and/or PRIMER_PAIR_EXPLAIN output tags
as appropriate. These output tags are intended to provide information on the number
 of oligos and primer pairs that primer3 examined and counts of the number discarded
 for various reasons. If -format_output is set similar information is produced in the
  user-oriented output. Here,default is 1}

\item{return}{is the input of PRIMER_NUM_RETURN, which is the maximum number of primer (pairs) to return. Primer pairs
returned are sorted by their "quality", in other words by the value of the objective function
(where a lower number indicates a better primer pair). Caution: setting this parameter to a
large value will increase running time. Here,default is 5}

\item{min_tm}{Minimum acceptable melting temperature (Celsius) for a primer oligo. Here,default is 45}

\item{opt_tm}{Optimum melting temperature (Celsius) for a primer. Primer3 will try
to pick primers with melting temperatures are close to this temperature. The oligo
melting temperature formula used can be specified by user. Please see PRIMER_TM_FORMULA
for more information. Here,default is 60}

\item{max_tm}{Maximum acceptable melting temperature (Celsius) for a primer oligo.Here,default is 60}
